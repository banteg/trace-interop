# Call return42

`trace_call` · a · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Stack words and storage operands use minimal hex quantities at every depth. The independently executable replay/raw root has exact costs, post-step gas, stack and memory effects. At every VM depth, every pc lies inside the code, PUSH matches bytecode, each step deducts its cost and a call or creation also receives its child leftover, subtraces appear only on calls and creations, MLOAD and call mem cover their operand range, and RETURN/REVERT report no mem. Root VM bytecode equals the independently frozen execution source. Every modelled step has exact opcode cost, post-step gas, stack effects, memory writes and storage effects. Modelled execution returns exactly the independently computed bytes.
