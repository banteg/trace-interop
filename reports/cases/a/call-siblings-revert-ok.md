# Call siblings revert ok

`trace_call` · a · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. The successful second sibling retains its output and has no error. Stack words and storage operands use minimal hex quantities at every depth. Failed frames have an error string; an exceptional halt omits result or sets it to null. A REVERT frame keeps result {gasUsed, output}; a reverted CREATE has no address or code. The fixture REVERT frame preserves its exact return bytes and opcode gas, regardless of error wording. At every VM depth, every pc lies inside the code, PUSH matches bytecode, each step deducts its cost and a call or creation also receives its child leftover, subtraces appear only on calls and creations, MLOAD and call mem cover their operand range, and RETURN/REVERT report no mem. Root VM bytecode equals the independently frozen execution source.
