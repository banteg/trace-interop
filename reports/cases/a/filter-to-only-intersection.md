`trace_filter` · a · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Compare address bytes: OR within each list, AND across lists by default and OR under mode union; missing/null/empty lists are unrestricted. A CREATE, SELFDESTRUCT or reward record matches the lists by its own from/to equivalents. Retain supporting reference evidence.
