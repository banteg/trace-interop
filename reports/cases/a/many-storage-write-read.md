# Many storage write read

`trace_callMany` · a · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Return one execution envelope per input call, in order. The second call reads the first call’s simulated write. Each call reports its own sender nonce transition, including a reverted call. Only the first call writes slot zero; reverted writes and later reads add no storage transition. Account balance deltas conserve transferred value, pay the exact miner tip and burn the selected block base fee and blob fee.
