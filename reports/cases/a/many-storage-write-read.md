# Many storage write read

`trace_callMany` · a · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Return one execution envelope per input call, in order. The second call reads the first call’s simulated write. Each call reports its own sender nonce transition, including a reverted call. Only the first call writes slot zero; reverted writes and later reads add no storage transition. Account balance deltas conserve transferred value, pay the exact miner tip and burn the selected block base fee, blob fee and any wei a same-transaction SELFDESTRUCT destroys.
