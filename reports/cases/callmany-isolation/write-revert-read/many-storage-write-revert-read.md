# Write revert read/many storage write revert read

`trace_callMany` · callmany-isolation · [All reports](../../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Return one execution envelope per input call, in order. Sequential calls retain prior writes and roll back reverted writes. Each call reports its own sender nonce transition, including a reverted call. Only the first call writes slot zero; reverted writes and later reads add no storage transition. Failed frames have an error string; an exceptional halt omits result or sets it to null. A REVERT frame keeps result {gasUsed, output}; a reverted CREATE has no address or code. Check accounting against independent gas. Account balance deltas conserve transferred value, pay the exact miner tip and burn the selected block base fee, blob fee and any wei a same-transaction SELFDESTRUCT destroys.
