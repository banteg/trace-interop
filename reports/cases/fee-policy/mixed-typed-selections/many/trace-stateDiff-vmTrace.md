`trace_callMany` · fee-policy · [All reports](../../../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Return one complete JSON-RPC response; never wrap an error envelope as a successful result. Return one execution envelope per input call, in order. Execute each valid simulation and return one envelope per call. Call 0: use BASEFEE zero for zero fees and the selected base fee for priced calls; preserve other block fields and expose upfront payment and prior settlement through BALANCE. Call 0: distinguish admission from the known execution success/failure. Call 0: settle exact gas, unused-gas/refund credits, transferred value, nonce, beneficiary tip and base-fee burn. Call 1: use BASEFEE zero for zero fees and the selected base fee for priced calls; preserve other block fields and expose upfront payment and prior settlement through BALANCE. Call 2: use BASEFEE zero for zero fees and the selected base fee for priced calls; preserve other block fields and expose upfront payment and prior settlement through BALANCE. Call 2: distinguish admission from the known execution success/failure.
