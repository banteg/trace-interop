`trace_call` · fee-policy · [All reports](../../../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Unrequested stateDiff is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Successful creation uses address, code and gasUsed. Stack words use minimal hex quantities at every depth. Execute each valid simulation and return one envelope per call. Call 0: preserve the block environment and effective price; expose upfront payment and prior settlement through BALANCE. Call 0: distinguish admission from the known execution success/failure.
