# Filter blockhash address from

`trace_filter` · h30 · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Optional hash selection may be explicitly rejected. For an accepted collection: Address matching applies to the hash-selected block as to the numeric single-block filter. Failed frames have an error string; an exceptional halt omits result or sets it to null. A REVERT frame keeps result {gasUsed, output}; a reverted CREATE has no address or code.
