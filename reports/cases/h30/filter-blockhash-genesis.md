# Filter blockhash genesis

`trace_filter` · h30 · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** The genesis hash selects the genesis block, which has no trace records: []. Failed frames have an error string; an exceptional halt omits result or sets it to null. A REVERT frame keeps result {gasUsed, output}; a reverted CREATE has no address or code.
