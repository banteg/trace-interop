# Call identity

`trace_call` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Unrequested stateDiff is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. The identity precompile call frame preserves its input as return bytes. Stack words use minimal hex quantities at every depth.
