# Call transfer statediff

`trace_call` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Unrequested trace is an empty array. Unrequested vmTrace is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. State-diff account markers agree with genesis and prior signed-transaction existence, including empty fields; a modelled new account is reported. Account balance deltas conserve transferred value, pay the exact miner tip and burn the selected block base fee, blob fee and any wei a same-transaction SELFDESTRUCT destroys. Assess the declared property.
