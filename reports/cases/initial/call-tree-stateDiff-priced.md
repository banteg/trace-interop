`trace_call` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Unrequested trace is an empty array. Unrequested vmTrace is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Unsigned execution accepts the supplied nonzero fee and returns one envelope per call; exact environment values are checked by coverage/model-environment. Check accounting against independent gas. Account balance deltas conserve transferred value, pay the exact miner tip and burn the selected block base fee, blob fee and any wei a same-transaction SELFDESTRUCT destroys. Successful creation uses address, code and gasUsed. Failed frames have an error string; an exceptional halt omits result or sets it to null. A REVERT frame keeps result {gasUsed, output}; a reverted CREATE has no address or code.
