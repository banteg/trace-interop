`trace_call` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Unrequested trace is an empty array. Unrequested vmTrace is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Assess this declared topic case. Successful creation uses address, code and gasUsed. Failed frames have an error string and an explicit object or null result.
