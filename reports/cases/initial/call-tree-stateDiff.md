`trace_call` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Explicit zero-fee unsigned execution is accepted; fee environment and accounting are checked separately. Assess the declared property. Unrequested trace is an empty array. Unrequested vmTrace is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Check accounting against independent gas.
