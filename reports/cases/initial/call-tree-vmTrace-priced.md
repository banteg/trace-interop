# Call tree vmtrace priced

`trace_call` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Unrequested trace is an empty array. Unrequested stateDiff is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Stack words and storage operands use minimal hex quantities at every depth. Unsigned execution accepts the supplied nonzero fee and returns one envelope per call; exact environment values are checked by coverage/model-environment. The replay/raw root VM is an object with the frozen initcode or resolved one-hop execution code, 0x when no code runs. At every VM depth, every pc lies inside the code, PUSH matches bytecode, each step deducts its cost and a call or creation also receives its child leftover or, entering no frame, includes the gas it forwarded, subtraces appear only on calls and creations, MLOAD mem is its loaded word, call mem is the output window or the copied return data, and RETURN/REVERT report no mem. Root VM bytecode equals the independently frozen execution source.
