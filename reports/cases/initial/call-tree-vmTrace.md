# Call tree vmtrace

`trace_call` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Explicit zero-fee unsigned execution is accepted; block-environment preservation needs additional checks. Assess the declared property. Unrequested trace is an empty array. Unrequested stateDiff is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Stack words use minimal hex quantities at every depth. The replay/raw root VM uses the frozen initcode or resolved one-hop execution code. At every VM depth, PUSH matches bytecode, non-call gas advances after the same operation, and reads/returns do not claim memory writes; CALL/CREATE gas boundaries are excluded. Root VM bytecode equals the independently frozen execution source.
