# Filter union

`trace_filter` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Compare address bytes: OR within each list, AND across lists by default and OR under mode union; missing/null/empty lists are unrestricted. Assess the declared property. Failed frames have an error string; an exceptional halt omits result or sets it to null. A REVERT frame keeps result {gasUsed, output}; a reverted CREATE has no address or code.
