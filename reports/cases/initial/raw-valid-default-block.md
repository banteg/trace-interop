# Raw valid default block

`trace_rawTransaction` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Return one complete JSON-RPC response; never wrap an error envelope as a successful result. Reject a signed transaction that fails execution validity at the selected state before EVM execution, for its own violation. Assess the declared property. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Stack words and storage operands use minimal hex quantities at every depth. The declared state-diff fixture returns the requested account changes. Inspect account-existence markers in the requested state diff. State-diff account markers agree with genesis and prior signed-transaction existence, including empty fields; a modelled new account is reported. Account balance deltas conserve transferred value, pay the exact miner tip and burn the selected block base fee, blob fee and any wei a same-transaction SELFDESTRUCT destroys.
