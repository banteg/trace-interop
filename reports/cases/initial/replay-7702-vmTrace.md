# Replay 7702 vmtrace

`trace_replayTransaction` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Individual replay includes its transactionHash. Unrequested trace is an empty array. Unrequested stateDiff is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Assess this declared topic case. trace_replayTransaction Stack words use minimal hex quantities at every depth.
