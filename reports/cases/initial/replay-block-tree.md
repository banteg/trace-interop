# Replay block tree

`trace_replayBlockTransactions` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Mined traces follow the same frame policy as simulations: omit the calltree’s nested zero-value identity call. Failed frames have an error string; an exceptional halt omits result or sets it to null. A REVERT frame keeps result {gasUsed, output}; a reverted CREATE has no address or code. A deleted account reports storage {} or optional old-slot - entries; account deletion implies every slot is wiped. The method responds without Method not found (-32601). Block replay has exactly one envelope per frozen transaction, with hashes in transaction order. The creation fixture contains its CREATE frame and successful creations include address, code and gasUsed. State-diff account markers agree with genesis and prior signed-transaction existence, including empty fields; a modelled new account is reported. The replay/raw root VM is an object with the frozen initcode or resolved one-hop execution code, 0x when no code runs. The independently executable replay/raw root has exact costs, post-step gas, stack and memory effects. Account balance deltas conserve transferred value, pay the exact miner tip and burn the selected block base fee, blob fee and any wei a same-transaction SELFDESTRUCT destroys. An account created and destroyed within the transaction is absent at both endpoints and has no account diff. Valid authorization tuples, folded per authority in order, change the recovered authority from its independently reconstructed code and nonce; invalid tuples change nothing. Replay VM numeric fields use nonnegative integers; stack words and storage operands use minimal quantities at every depth. At every VM depth, every pc lies inside the code, PUSH matches bytecode, each step deducts its cost and a call or creation also receives its child leftover or, entering no frame, includes the gas it forwarded, subtraces appear only on calls and creations, MLOAD mem is its loaded word, call mem is the output window or the copied return data, and RETURN/REVERT report no mem.
