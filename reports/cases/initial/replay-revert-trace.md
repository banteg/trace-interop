# Replay revert trace

`trace_replayTransaction` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Individual replay includes its transactionHash. Unrequested vmTrace is null. Unrequested stateDiff is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Failed frames have an error string and an explicit object or null result. The fixture REVERT frame preserves its exact return bytes and opcode gas, regardless of error wording. Assess this declared topic case. trace_replayTransaction
