# Replay revert vmtrace

`trace_replayTransaction` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Individual replay includes its transactionHash. Unrequested trace is an empty array. Unrequested stateDiff is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Every operation names its op and has only the specified members; stack words and storage operands use minimal hex quantities at every depth. The method responds without Method not found (-32601). The independently executable replay/raw root has exact costs, post-step gas, stack and memory effects. At every VM depth, every pc lies inside the code, PUSH matches bytecode, each step deducts its cost and a call or creation also receives its child leftover or, entering no frame, includes the gas it forwarded, subtraces appear only on calls and creations, MLOAD mem is its loaded word, call mem is the output window or the copied return data, and RETURN/REVERT report no mem. trace_replayTransaction Assess the declared property.
