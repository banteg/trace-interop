# Replay tree vmtrace

`trace_replayTransaction` · initial · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Individual replay includes its transactionHash. Unrequested trace is an empty array. Unrequested stateDiff is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Stack words and storage operands use minimal hex quantities at every depth. The method responds without Method not found (-32601). The replay/raw root VM is an object with the frozen initcode or resolved one-hop execution code, 0x when no code runs. At every VM depth, every pc lies inside the code, PUSH matches bytecode, each step deducts its cost and a call or creation also receives its child leftover, subtraces appear only on calls and creations, MLOAD and call mem cover their operand range, and RETURN/REVERT report no mem. trace_replayTransaction Assess the declared property.
