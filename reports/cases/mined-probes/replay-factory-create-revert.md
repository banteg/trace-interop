# Replay factory create revert

`trace_replayTransaction` · mined-probes · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Individual replay includes its transactionHash. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Every operation names its op and has only the specified members; stack words and storage operands use minimal hex quantities at every depth. Failed frames have an error string; an exceptional halt carries result null. A REVERT frame keeps result {gasUsed, output}; a reverted CREATE has no address or code. The sender pays value, receipt gas at the effective price and any blob fee, and its nonce advances once. The fee recipient gains exactly the priority fee on the receipt gas. The factory call contains its failed nested create frame. The handled nested failure leaves the root successful; root gasUsed is its execution gas, action.gas excludes intrinsic gas. A reverted nested CREATE reports error Reverted and result {gasUsed, output} without address or code. The would-be address of a reverted nested CREATE has no account diff. The creator’s nonce increment survives its child’s REVERT. State-diff account markers agree with genesis and prior signed-transaction existence, including empty fields; a modelled new account is reported. Account balance deltas conserve transferred value, pay the exact miner tip and burn the selected block base fee, blob fee and any wei a same-transaction SELFDESTRUCT destroys. trace_replayTransaction Assess the declared property.
