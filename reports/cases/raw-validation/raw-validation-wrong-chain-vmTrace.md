# Raw validation wrong chain vmtrace

`trace_rawTransaction` · raw-validation · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Return one complete JSON-RPC response; never wrap an error envelope as a successful result. Unrequested trace is an empty array. Unrequested stateDiff is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Stack words use minimal hex quantities at every depth. Reject a signed transaction that fails execution validity at the selected state before EVM execution. Proposed transaction-validation error code: -32003 (Transaction rejected). Assess the declared property.
