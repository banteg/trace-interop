# Raw insufficient funds trace

`trace_rawTransaction` · repeat · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Return one complete JSON-RPC response; never wrap an error envelope as a successful result. Reject a signed transaction that fails execution validity at the selected state before EVM execution. Proposed transaction-validation error code: -32003 (Transaction rejected). Unrequested vmTrace is null. Unrequested stateDiff is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection. Assess the declared property.
