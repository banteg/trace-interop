# Raw nonce high statediff

`trace_rawTransaction` · repeat · [All reports](../../README.md)

**What this checks:** Return one complete JSON-RPC response; never wrap an error envelope as a successful result. Proposed admission policy: reject a signed nonce mismatch rather than replace it; client agreement is pending. Unrequested trace is an empty array. Unrequested vmTrace is null. Output remains a byte string under every trace selection.
