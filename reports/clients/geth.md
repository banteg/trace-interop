# Geth draft fork: changes to review

The experimental fork follows the adopted source-review stances; its checked cases agree on every assessed decision, including pending simulations, which it runs in a real pending environment; pending block traces stay blocked on the frozen chain’s empty pending block, and one H14 input policy is open; it rejects the H12 raw-transaction block argument, an extension outside the baseline. It is not upstream Geth support or a consensus vote. Filtering remains a bounded scan; pruning still needs runtime coverage.

**Progress on 1.17.7-unstable · e26833e3** (of 33 decisions): ✅ 29 agree · ⚠️ 1 with no fix yet · ❔ 1 policy open · ⚪ 2 not fully measured. Upstream fix PRs: 0 merged, 1 open ([client fixes](../../docs/client-fixes.md)).

| `1.17.7-unstable` | [`e26833e3`](https://github.com/banteg/go-ethereum/commit/e26833e3322f918c365f74be6971061c41736fc5) | 2026-09-26 | [2026-09-29](../../evidence/2026-09-29/refresh/initial/manifest.json) |

Code links use the tested development sources (or the Geth fork). These are proposed changes for the tested builds. “Checked cases agree” refers to the linked examples, not every behavior of a method. [Test status key](../technical.md#test-status-key).

## Changes to discuss

| Behavior | 1.17.7-unstable · e26833e3 | Proposed change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Single-block hash selection in trace_filter](../decisions/H33.md)<br>Rejects every non-null `blockHash` as an unknown field (-32602), so it passes the error cases, including the reorg phases, and differs wherever block 2’s records are expected. A null `blockHash` beside numeric bounds is dropped as omitted. | ⚠️ Differs<br>[Filter blockhash](../cases/h30/filter-blockhash.md) | Add the member to the draft fork’s filter type and select exactly the hashed block in one chain view.<br>[Address filtering](https://github.com/banteg/go-ethereum/blob/fa8ecb9242dda61858c44cf43c70d00548fbd7cd/eth/tracers/trace_namespace.go#L187) |

## Open policy observations

These results record behavior whose policy is unresolved. Passing a checked part of a topic does not settle the remaining choices.

| Build | Decision | Observed | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.17.7-unstable · e26833e3 | [Raw-transaction block argument](../decisions/H12.md) | 6 extension cases. Selector block 0x0 by number: rejected as invalid params (-32602: too many arguments, want at most 2). Selector latest: rejected as invalid params (-32602: too many arguments, want at most 2). Selector block 0x19 by number: rejected as invalid params (-32602: too many arguments, want at most 2). Selector block 0x19 by hash: rejected as invalid params (-32602: too many arguments, want at most 2). Selector block 0x19 as an EIP-1898 object: rejected as invalid params (-32602: too many arguments, want at most 2). Selector pending: rejected as invalid params (-32602: too many arguments, want at most 2). | [Raw valid](../cases/initial/raw-valid.md) · [Raw state hash](../cases/raw-selector/raw-state-hash.md) |
| 1.17.7-unstable · e26833e3 | [Invalid parameters and rejected calls](../decisions/H14.md) | 1 policy-open case. Mixing legacy gasPrice with an authorizationList is an open input policy, since no signed transaction type carries both; the response does not isolate the authorization field, which field-authorization-1559 asserts with EIP-1559 fees. Observed: Expected a result; observed rpc_error -32602 gasPrice conflicts with blob or authorization fields | [Field authorization](../cases/probes-prague/field-authorization.md) |

## Assessment gaps

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| [Trace block tags and pending state](../decisions/H32.md) | 1.17.7-unstable · e26833e3 | 2 blocked cases: An empty result names no block, so it cannot show a pending environment. | [Block pending](../cases/h30/block-pending.md) · [Replay pending](../cases/h30/replay-pending.md) |
